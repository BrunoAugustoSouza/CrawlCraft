When news about the government shutdown broke, they thought they may not get to visit Liberty Island, which has an on-site museum, but decided to take their chances.\n\"We just showed up,\" Hill told a reporter, happy that her family got to see the iconic statue. \"I think our government's not being managed as well as it could be or should be. But there's only so much in our control.\"\nThegovernment shutdown,the 15th since 1981, has led to the suspension of scientific research, economic data reports and a wide range of other activities. The situation at the country's 63 national parks has been less than clear-cut, however.\nTo the delight of Hill and other tourists, the Trump administration announced on Thursday morning that it had decided to keep the Statue of Liberty and nearby Ellis Island open.\nOnly a day earlier, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the state would not step in to keep the sites up and running as it did in previous shutdowns. Together, the two sites in New York Harbor drew 3.7 million people last year.\nVisitors to the late President Jimmy Carter's grave in Plains, Georgia, were not so lucky. Philip Kurland, owner of a local gift shop, reported a threefold increase in traffic on Wednesday - the 101st anniversary of Carter's birth - but said visitors were turned away from the main attractions.\n\"They've all been disappointed,\" Kurland said. \"They wanted to pay their respects\" to the former president, who died last December at age 100.\nIn Philadelphia, a red banner on the Philadelphia Visitor Center's website announced the Independence National Historical Park buildings, including those that house the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, were closed.\nThe visitor center at Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta was closed, denying visitors a look at the original Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the celebrated civil rights leader preached.\nThe National Park Service had developed a contingency plan that called for furloughing more than 9,000 of its 14,500 workers in the event of a shutdown and outlined what services would remain available.\nMost park roads and trails would \"generally remain accessible to visitors,\" the nine-page plan said, but visitor centers and bathrooms would close. Even so, the centers at Ellis and Liberty islands in New York Harbor were open on Thursday.\nThe service planned to suspend guided tours, routine maintenance or trash collection, but law enforcement, emergency response and fire suppression would continue as usual.\nThe decision to allow visitors to enter most parks even while furloughing thousands of workers may have pleased some visitors, but it likely upset more than 40 former national park superintendents who last week urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to completely close all parks during a shutdown.\nIn an open letter they said that \"iconic symbols\" at some parks were vandalized in previous shutdowns, while piles of trash accumulated and the safety of visitors was jeopardized.\nCalifornia's Joshua Tree National Park, named after the spiked yucca plants that grow across the park’s high-desert landscape, suffered damage during a 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.\n\"A lot of folks decided that since there was no law enforcement, that meant that they would break the rules and drive off-road and cut down trees and things like that,\" said John Lauretig, president of Friends of Joshua Tree. \"I worry about our national parks not being protected.\"\nAt Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, scores of tourists lined a road running alongside a meadow on Thursday as a bull elk kept watch over a herd of 25 cows. But the visitor center, located 11,976 feet (3,650 m) above sea level, was closed.\nOctober marks peak season at the park, which draws some 19,000 people a day to see the explosion of autumn color in its forests.\nPark staffers were unwilling to speak on the record but they expressed concerns about safeguarding visitors and the park's impressive natural beauty during the shutdown.\n“Our national parks are our common ground,” said Joann Brennan, 63, a photography professor working on a project capturing images of the parks. “No matter what political party you are, it really is common ground because there's a joy that we share when we experience places like this.”"},

Koizumi is seen as someone who could forge consensus with other parties while Takaichi would shake up \"a world of rather grey politicians\", she said.\nIf chosen, Koizumi would be a few months older than Hirobumi Ito when he became Japan's first prime minister in 1885, under the nation's prewar constitution.\nKoizumi leads among the 295 LDP lawmakers who will vote for party leader, followed by Hayashi and Takaichi, according to an Asahi newspaper report on Wednesday.

She has promised to double the size of the economy in a decade with heavy state investment in new technologies, infrastructure, food production and other areas of economic security.\nShe has said she would carry over Ishiba's trade agreement with Trump, in which Japan agreed to invest $550 billion in the U.S. in return for lower tariffs on automobiles and other Japanese products, but mentioned the possibility of renegotiation if the deal proves to be unfair.\nCabinet ministers Hayashi and Koizumi have defended the deal.\nFor whoever wins, one of their first acts as premier is expected to behosting Trumpin Tokyo at the end of October, Reuters has reported.\nDomestically they face the tall task of rejuvenating a party increasingly seen as out of touch with voters, said James Brown, a politics professor at Temple University in Tokyo.\n\"There's every possibility that we'll be returning to this issue of yet another election for the leadership of the country before too long,\" Brown said."},

He repeated the line this week.\n\"A paper tiger. What follows then? Go and deal with this paper tiger,\" Putin said. \"Well if we are fighting with the entire NATO bloc, we are moving, advancing, and we feel confident, and we are a 'paper tiger', then what is NATO itself?\"\nPutin poured irony on European claims that Russian drones had invaded NATO airspace, quipping that he promised he would not do it again in Denmark and that he did not have drones that could fly to Lisbon.\nEuropean authorities have accused Russia ofbrazen violationsof the region's airspace, including with recent incursions by drones over Poland and fighter jets over Estonia.\nHe took a more serious tone about the possibility of the United States supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, saying that such a step would lead to a dangerous new wave of escalation.\n\"It is impossible to use Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel,\" Putin said. \"This will mean a completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the United States.\"\nThe United States has so far not announced any decision on supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine.\nNATO members, he said, were providing Ukraine with intelligence, weapons and training, and whipping up what he cast as hysteria about alleged plans of Russia to attack a NATO member, which he dismissed as \"impossible to believe\".\n\"If anyone still has a desire to compete with us in the military sphere, as we say, feel free, let them try,\" Putin said. \"Russia's countermeasures will not be long in coming.\"\nPutin portrays the war as a watershed moment in Moscow's relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence.\nWestern European leaders and Ukraine cast the war as an imperial-style land grab and have repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces. They argue that unless Russia is defeated, Putin will risk an attack on a NATO member.\n\"I just want to say: Cool down, sleep calmly, and take care of your own problems. Just take a look at what's happening on the streets of European cities,\" Putin said.\nPutin said Ukraine's armed forces had a grave lack of manpower and desertions, while Russia had enough soldiers. He suggested that Kyiv should negotiate an end to the war.\nRussia, he said, controlled almost all of Luhansk province, about 81% of the Donetsk region, and about 75% of both Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions."},

The plan has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and from former department employees, who say it could hurt critical work.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said the reductions in force \"will save the Department over $11 million and further President Trump’s mission of having a federal government that’s more efficient and effective for the American people.\"\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has embarked on a sweeping campaign to remake the federal government, sharply cutting back international aid and environmental regulation, while redirecting a wide range of federal resources towards an immigration crackdown.\nThe documents do not include a plan, first reported in March, to merge the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. That idea faced a bipartisan backlash in Congress, as well as resistance from DEA and ATF employees and opposition from both gun control and gun rights organizations.\nIt was not clear whether the merger could be reconsidered at a future time.

Offices that handle criminal consumer protection cases and human-trafficking prosecutions will also be merged into the Criminal Division."},

Inmy column todayI look at why the U.S. government shutdown is the last thing the Federal Reserve needs right now - visibility around the labor market and inflation for data-dependent policymakers was already limited, and this just reduces it even more.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\nToday's Key Market Moves\nToday's Talking Points:\n* The AI Emperor - clothes or no clothes?\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion following a recent share sale, making it the most valuable private company in the world. That's up sharply from its current valuation of $300 billion. Where next? $1 trillion?\nIt's a landmark moment but raises familiar questions about whether the AI boom is a bubble. AI-related capex spending in the U.S. is soaring but a lot is on imports, so is actually an offset to GDP growth. And the bar for future returns is high. But as long as the music is playing, investors will keep dancing.\n* What's going on with oil?\nOil prices are sliding. Fast. Brent and WTI crude futures are down nearly 10% in the last week, scraping four-month lows of $64.00 and $60.40 a barrel, respectively, as oversupply concerns grip the market.\nOPEC+ countries meet this weekend and could agree to raise oil production by up to 500,000 barrels per day in November, sources tell Reuters. That would be triple the increase for October. Oil's disinflationary momentum is building.\n* De-dollarization - a bit of a myth?\nIMF figures this week showed that the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves in Q2 dipped to 56.3% - the lowest since at least the euro's launch in 1999 - from 57.7% in Q1.\nBut adjusted for exchange rates, the dollar's share held steady, the IMF said. According to Goldman Sachs, it actually rose for the second quarter in a row, and as capital flows expert Brad Setser notes, the official sector's nominal dollar holdings in recent years have been \"basically constant\". So no de-dollarization then, at least from central banks.\nU.S. government shutdown gives Fed last thing it needs - even less visibility\nAfter the Federal Reserve resumed its interest rate-cutting cycle last month, Chair Jerome Powell signaled that incoming U.S. economic data would play an even more critical role than usual in determining the central bank's next steps. But the government shutdown means the Fed may now be walking blind.\n\"We're in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we're going to be looking at the data,\" Powell told reporters after the 25-basis-point cut on September 17, adding: \"There are no risk-free paths now.\"\nThose paths have just gotten a whole lot riskier.\nThe government shutdown that began on Wednesday coulddelay the releaseof a large chunk of economic data, meaning the Fed's ability to accurately assess the labor market and inflation situation – which was already limited – will now be much worse. That, in turn, could make the market rethink its own conviction about the near-term rate outlook.\nKey employment and inflation data are set to be delayed, namely weekly jobless claims from the Labor Department, and all-important monthly non-farm payrolls and CPI inflation reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe September payrolls and CPI inflation reports are due for release this Friday and October 15, respectively. They would probably be the biggest single influences in rate setters' decisions at the October 28-29 Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.\nAs Rabobank analysts note, thick with understatement, this is \"very inconvenient\" for the Fed as these two data points could potentially tilt the balance between the hawks and the doves on the FOMC.\nThe FOMC's September 'dot plot' showed a median estimate of two more rate cuts this year, but it wouldn't take much to change that. The split of views showed that nine of the FOMC's 19 members expect only one more cut - or none - by December.\nThere is a clear polarization of views. Does a shutdown strengthen the doves' hand?\nA quarter-point cut in October is already fully priced into rates futures markets. Another \"insurance\" cut, as Powell described September's move, would make sense - better to avoid the risk of falling behind the curve and being forced to ease more aggressively later.\nThis is particularly true in the event of a prolonged shutdown, which could put a 50-basis-point cut on the table in October or December.\nOxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet estimates that even a partial shutdown reduces GDP growth by 0.1-0.2 percentage points per week. To put that into context, the longest shutdown on record of over 35 days in President Donald Trump's first term would reduce fourth-quarter real GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 percentage points.\nBut there's also a compelling case for not easing at all, never mind pouring fuel on the fire with cuts made in a haze of uncertainty rather than on data-led evidence, as Powell has insisted upcoming decisions will be based.\nThe hawks' base case appears to be strengthening - GDP growth is running close to 4% on an annualized basis, inflation is nearly a percentage point above target and showing few signs of cooling, and Wall Street is at record highs. It's unclear whether a government shutdown of a few days, or even weeks, would weaken the hawks' narrative.\nOne thing that most policymakers and economists do agree on is that thequality and reliabilityof U.S. economic data are deteriorating, in no small part due to falling response rates to surveys. This leads to skewed or inaccurate results, and more and bigger revisions.\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that standard errors are 26% higher on average today than in 2015-2019, and have increased for eight out of 10 government surveys they review. Labor market data appear to have been affected most by falling survey response rates, they note.\n\"This is an old problem, and old solutions continue to be relevant today: gather more data,\" Anna Kovner, director of research at the Richmond Fed, concludes in anarticle published on Wednesday, opens new tab.\nThat, of course, will have to wait, probably until long after the shutdown is over. Is patchy data preferable to no data at all? We could be about to find out.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?
